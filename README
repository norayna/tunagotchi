TUNAGOTCHI
Computer Systems 2 Project by Rayna Bozhkova - 14 May 2018.

This is a frantic tamagotchi game. Tuna is a fragile tuna and it needs attention and love in order to stay alive.

I load it on Linux by using the following commands:

avr-gcc -mmcu=at90usb1286 -DF_CPU=8000000 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fno-strict-aliasing -Wno-main -Wstrict-overflow=5 -fstrict-overflow -Winline -Os main.c -o main.elf
avr-objcopy -O ihex main.elf main.hex

Then clicking the reset button, then:

sudo dfu-programmer at90usb1286 erase
sudo dfu-programmer at90usb1286 flash main.hex
sudo dfu-programmer at90usb1286 start

I've been told Klaus's universal makefile also works and it is included in this, however it does not work on my machine.
I also have copies of all the header files in the same directory as the main.c file. Your machine might not need this.

Have fun and don't kill your Tuna!!
